# OOPs in C++

When the program are written through Object Oriented Programming Languages like C++ , Java , Python, Javascript etc. it is known as Object Oriented Programming ( OOP )

  <summary><strong>🎯 Objects</strong></summary>  

  - Objects are entities in the real world
  - Basic runtime entity in any OOP language
  - An object is a class instance that allows programmers to use variables and methods from inside the class
  - 📝 Consists of three parts :
    1. ID
    2. Properties / Attribute ( State )
    3. Operations / Behaviours ( Function )

</details>

<hr>

<details>  
  <summary><strong>🎯 Class</strong></summary>  

  - Class is like a blueprint of these entities
  - Collection of objects of similar type
  - Class is a keyword for creating user-defined data type
  - Class is a mould , template or blueprint for creating objects 
  - A class is a blueprint for declaring and creating objects
  - 📝 Consists of :
    1. Set of Attributes ( Data Members )
    2. Set of Operations / Behaviours ( Member Function )

<details>  
  <summary><strong>🎯 Access Modifiers</strong></summary>  

1. Private ( Default ): Data and methods accessible inside class
2. Public : Data and methods accessible to everyone
3. Protected : Data and methods accessible inside class and to its derived class

## 📌 Four pillars of OOPs :
  1. **Inheritance**
  2. **Polymorphism**
  3. **Abstraction**
  4. **Encapsulation**

<details>  
  <summary><strong>🎯 Constructor</strong></summary>  

Special method invoked automatically at the time of object creation. Used for initialisation.

- Same name as class
- Constructor doesn't have a return type
- Only called once (automatically), at object creation
- Memory allocation happens when constructor is called

Types :
1. Parameterised
2. Non-Parameterised
3. Copy

<details>  
  <summary><strong>🎯 Inheritance</strong></summary>  

- It allows classes to inherit common properties from the parent class
- Process of obtaining a new class from an existing class
  - Existing class = Parent class
  - New class = Derived or Sub class
- Most important use - Code reusability  

Types of Inheritance:
1. Single Level
2. Multi Level
3. Heirarchical Inheritance
4. Multiple Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance

<details>  
  <summary><strong>🎯 Polymorphism</strong></summary>  

- Polymorphism is the ability to exist in many forms
- An operation having  same external interface with different internal structure

    
</details>

<hr>

<details>  
  <summary><strong>🎯 Abstraction</strong></summary>  

- It displays only the important information by hiding the implementation part
    
</details>

<hr>

<details>  
  <summary><strong>🎯 Encapsulation ( Data hiding & Encapsulation )</strong></summary>  

- Encapsulation is **wrapping up** of data & member functions in a single unit called class 
- Data member are hidden inside the object and not accessible from outer object
- Binding data and code together into one unit
